# iCapture-Pricing
Pricing page with lead capture form

### Info
Because of the complexity involved with trying to replicate the existing iCapture WP environment and the discomfort of working directly with pages and styles on a live site, I have created a discrete webpage with the html and css clearly laid out for copying to the live iCapture site by a qualified developer.
Email me with any questions!

- The index.html contains the HTML that should be able to drop into the Pricing page, replacing the current pricing panels. Look for a comment called
```<!-- iCapture Pricing Panel with Form -->```
This will provide everything needed including the embedded form provided by Tami.

- All of the CSS used can be found in the CSS folder in the "main.css" file
